# UAV-Sizing-and-Control-Design-Tool
Kode for Initial Sizing - Unmanned Aerial Vehicles - (KIS-UAV) 
Developed by Dr. Bilal A. Siddiqui, Mechanical Eng. Dept., DHA Suffa University 
with students Hiba Ashraf, Adam Asif, Mohsin Ahmed and Shoib Ahmed.
Additional support and collaboration from Farrukh Mustahsin of Machines Lab, DSU.

1. This code in Matlab/Simulink begins with taking inputs about mission statement and some initial user defined parameters
2. This is followed by initial aircraft sizing
3. The designed aircraft is then modeled in USAF S&C Datcom, a compendium of semi-empirical methods for predicting aerodynamics
4. The inertial and aerodynamic data is then used to build control systems for the longitudinal of the aircraft.
